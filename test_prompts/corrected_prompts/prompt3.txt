Design a test plan for an e-commerce checkout system.

To ensure the functionality and reliability of the e-commerce checkout system, it is important to design a comprehensive test plan. This plan should include the following steps:

1. Identify the functional requirements: Begin by identifying the key functionalities that the e-commerce checkout system should have. This may include features such as product selection, payment processing, order confirmation, and user authentication.

2. Define test scenarios: Once the functional requirements are identified, define specific test scenarios that cover all possible use cases and edge cases. For example, test scenarios could include testing the system's ability to handle multiple concurrent user transactions, testing the system's response to invalid inputs, and testing the system's error handling capabilities.

3. Determine test data: Determine the test data that will be used to execute the test scenarios. This may include sample products, payment information, and user credentials. Ensure that the test data covers a wide range of scenarios to thoroughly test the system's functionality.

4. Develop test cases: Based on the defined test scenarios and test data, develop detailed test cases that outline the steps to be followed during testing. Each test case should include a description
